Anatomy of a basic **psiTurk** project
==========================================

Every **psiTurk** compatible project should include a few basic files.
As an example here is the file listing of the `Stroop example <stroop.html>`__
which is included in a default **psiTurk** installation.

These files might all seem mysterious at first, but this section of the
documentation explains their purpose.  Of course, projects can include additional
files as needed but these are basics that most projects will want to include.
