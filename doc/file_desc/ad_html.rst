ad.html
=======

This is a very important file.  It contains the
text of your HTML ad.  This is the first thing
participants taking your experiment will see.
This file exists locally.  When you are `debugging <../command_line/debug.html>`__
in local mode, the local file will be used.
When you create an ad on the `Ad Server <../secure_ad_server.html>`__, a copy
of this file is uploaded to the **psiTurk** cloud
server.


.. seealso::

   `psiturk.org Secure Ad Server <../secure_ad_server.html>`__
   	  You ad.html file is uploaded and stored on the
   	  Secure Ad Server when you create a hit.

   `Command line tool for creating HITs <../command_line/hit.html>`__
   	  Info on how to create a HIT using the command line.

The structure of this file is very particular.
There are two ways your ad will be viewed.
First, when a potential participants is simply browsing
the website, the will see one version of the ad.
When the "Accept" the ad, the will see a second version
that may include addition information (such as
providing the link to launch your actual experiment).

These two types of adds are contained in the same file.
Which one is displayed is set by the `Jinja template <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`
The basic structure is:

::

	{% if assignmentid == "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE" %}

		HTML/CSS FOR AD BEFORE ACCEPTING

	{% else %}

		HTML/CSS FOR AD AFTER ACCEPTING

	{% endif %}

.. important::

	You cannot directly reference addition CSS or JS files
	in the ad since the ad server will host the ad
	using https://.  As a result you need to include all
	CSS styles you want applied to your ad directly in the
	file.  boostrap.min.css is provided for free by
	the ad server.

For example, here is an example template that comes
with the default `stroop example <../stroop.html>`__.

::

	<!doctype html>
	<!--
		The ad.html has a very specific format.

		Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

		The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
		the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
		your hit.

		The second part of the ad display after the person selected
		"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
		ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
		open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
		server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

		See comments throughout for hints
