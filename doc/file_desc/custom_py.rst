custom.py
=========

This file is optional.  Most projects may not need this file
at all.  However, if you would like to extend the functionality
of **psiTurk** in various ways, this file may be for you.  In particular,
this allows you to define custom "routes" or "urls" in your project.
One example where this might be used is for creating routes that compute
a participant's bonus automatically.
