The `static/css/` directory
===========================

This directory should hold all the CSS
files you would like to use in your experiment
(by default includes
files shipped with `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com>`__
and a style.css file which overrides some of those
styles for particular parts of the instructions, ad, etc...).
