The `static/js/` directory
==========================

This folder should contain all your custom
Javascript code for your project.  In the
Stroop example, this includes 'task.js' which
includes the logic for the experiment and
'util.js' which includes some supporting/mathematical
functions.  You can add additional files as
needed for your project.
